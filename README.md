Sophisticated. Elegant. Open Source. The iNecklace is a gorgeously machined aluminum pendant with a subtle pulsating LED. Perfect for the playa or with Prada. Made for women who celebrate art, science, engineering and great design. For any lady who loves technology and wants beautiful, geeky jewelry. Welcome to the future!

This is a new type of product for Adafruit, we want to create wearable electronics that are subtle, fun to wear and look classy.

The necklace pendant is CNC machined from the finest 6 series aluminum for durability and beauty. The iNecklace is a remarkable accessory. Machined with a "screw in backing" that allows easy access to the battery using a coin. Each iNecklace pendant contains a circuit board with pulsating LED and battery. The pendant comes strung on a 18" long sterling silver 1.6mm diamond-cut curb chain that has been treated to inhibit tarnishing. The necklace is placed in a black velveteen box, ready to given as a gift!

Reverse engineered
The "pulsing" is similar to the "breathing" LED pattern on many laptop and computer systems. The default pattern is [reverse engineered](https://blog.adafruit.com/2010/08/26/reverse-engineering-the-mac-breathing-led-2/) from the Apple "breathing" LED on Macs, MacBooks, iMacs, etc.

Open source
The iNecklace is completely open source. The source code, circuit board files, schematics and CAD files are posted on GitHub. Mod & Hack away! The iNecklace can be reprogrammed to any pattern you'd like!


Ready to go
Before your fancy event, just pop the battery in, screw the backing on and your iNecklace will gently pulsate for up to 72 hours. Each order comes with 2 batteries, one for immediate gratification, and one spare. Simply replace it when the LED is too dim to see. [We sell high quality replacement batteries as well](http://www.adafruit.com/products/380).

Designed and made in North America
Cufflinks are lovingly machined in Toronto, Canada by Ross + Doell, assembled in New York, New York USA. Created by Mike Doell, Limor Fried and Phillip Torrone.
